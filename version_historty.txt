09/07/2019:
Added the tree simplification algorithms implemented with the chain of responsibility pattern.

12/07/2019:
Seaparated the hash calculation method into new classes.

14/07/2019:
Bug fixes.
SimplifyTrees implements an observer pattern to invoke a handler after the simplification process.

16/07/2019:
Removed the RunExperiments folder as it is not needed any more.

16/07/2019:
Cleaned the 'resource' directory and renamed it to 'resources'.

17/07/2019:
Moved the extractor programs into the 'tl.knowledge.extraction' package.

17/07/2019:
Created the 'SimplifiedTreeBuilder' class to transfer the trees that have been simplified.

22/07/2019:
Moved 'AlgebraicSimplifier' to its correct package.

01/09/2019
Corrected the 'EvaluateOnTest' program so that now it saves the evaluated files to a separate location.

10/09/2019
Added the PIPE learning algorithm. At this stage, only the learning based on frequency is implemented.

14/09/2019
Added the niching feature to the PPT extraction algorithm.
Some algorithms will throw an exception if their knowledge directory is empty.

17/09/2019
Added the PPTEvolutionState

18/09/2019
Removed a bug in PPTExtractor that didn't check the percent value it received.
Added niching to the PPTEvolutionState

22/09/19
Finished implementing MutatingSubtreeBuilder.

24/09/19
Finished and debugged implementation of PIPE extraction in ExtractPPT.

01/10/19
Fixed a bug that did not log the fitness of the source individuals in SimpleCodeFragmentBuilder.

02/10/19
Added the ability to allow or reject duplicates.

06/10/19
Added the ability to simplify trees before extracting PPTs.

11/10/19
Improved the FrequencyLearner class so that now it can use ranked selection as well as tournament selection.

20/12/19
Added PPTBreeding and PPTEvolutionaryState.
Added the min probability threshold.
Removed a bug that did not update probability values correctly.

31/12/19
Implemented the idea of complement PPT and updated PPTBreeding with it.

01/01/20
Corrected a bug in FrequencyLearner.

14/01/20
Implemented the clearing method.

17/01/20
Completed the phenotypic characterisation.
This is a temporary version. There are a few issues at this stage:
- There is a memory bug in the Instance.clone and as a result, it is not possible to have a correct record of the seen decision situations.
- FrequencyLearner uses a hardcoded simplifier.

26/02/20
This is the first version that contains a semi-correct surrogate method. This version just implements a simple surrogate
that uses the whole previous generation as the pool for the surrogate method.

27/02/20
Removed a caching bug in the surrogate method.
Added a clearing to the intermediate population.

09/03/20
Implemented different policies for updating surrogate pools.

11/03/20
Modified SurrogateBuilder. Now, it initialises GP with individuals from the surrogate pool.

16/03/20
Completed the entropy update policy for knn pools.

27/03/20
Added the DBScan algorithm for entropy clustering. Added correlation phenotypic implementations.

07/05/20
Added the implementation for the 'ClearedFullTree' method.

16/05/20
Added the feature to disable surrogate evaluation to SurEvalBuilder.
